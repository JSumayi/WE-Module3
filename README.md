 WE-Module3: Generative AI Coursework

 This repository contains the coursework and code for the Generative AI classes taken as part of Module 3 in the Women Engineers program offered by Talentsprint and supported by Google.
 Work Done:
 - Solved a computational thinking question using GenAI, applying concepts learned in class to solve a real-world problem.
 - Implemented a GenAI-based version of the Yahtzee game, including code for rolling dice, calculating scores, and implementing a testing strategy to ensure code correctness.
 - Utilized a Markov chain model for text generation, demonstrating the ability to generate text that mimics the style and structure of the input text.
